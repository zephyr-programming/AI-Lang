Create a Golang program that implements a simple HTTP web server. The server should:

1. Handle GET requests to the root path ("/") and respond with a welcome message.
2. Serve static files from a "static" directory for any requests to paths that match files in that directory.
3. Include proper logging of incoming requests and any errors that occur.
4. Gracefully handle invalid routes by returning a 404 Not Found response with a custom message.
5. Support configurable server settings, such as the port number, through command-line flags.
6. Ensure the server is concurrent and can handle multiple requests simultaneously using goroutines.
