Create a Golang program that implements a command-line calculator. The calculator should:

1. Support basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. Accept input in the form of a mathematical expression (e.g., "3 + 4 * 2").
3. Handle operator precedence and parentheses correctly.
4. Include error handling for invalid expressions and division by zero.
5. Allow users to perform multiple calculations in a single session until they choose to exit.
6. Provide a clean and user-friendly interface with clear prompts and output.
